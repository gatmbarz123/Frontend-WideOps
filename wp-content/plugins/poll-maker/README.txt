== WordPress Poll maker plugin features, advantages ==

= Poll question =

There is a default **WordPress classic editor** for adding and editing the question. You can use it for formatting your question text. Most importantly, it allows you to create an *image poll, video poll or audio poll*. If you have CSS or HTML skills, you are free to write your own code and design your question the way you wish it to be. Moreover, you can insert a shortcode of any other plugin easily. This WordPress Vote plugin's developers continually do their best to build the *Best WordPress Poll Plugin* ever. All you need is to grab the chance and give it a try!

= Poll types =

This WordPress Poll plugin allows you to make 7 types of online polls:

* **Choosing** - You can add as many options for choosing as you want. There is also an option that allows users to add their custom option(Pro).
* **Rating** - With this type, you can make voting forms with rating a single product. It allows you to choose the type of rating: **with stars or with emojis**. It depends on the subject you want to examine.
* **Voting** - With this type, you can make voting forms with voting. Here are again two types: **like/dislike** or emojis. It is an easy way to understand users love your product or not.
* **Dropdown** (Available only in [Pro version](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/poll-maker)) - You need to write the possible answers in the field of 'Answers', which are 2 by default. The participants need to choose one answer from a list of choices presented in a dropdown menu.
* **Range** (Available only in [Pro version](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/poll-maker)) - It allows a participant to select answers in 1-100 range.
* **VS (versus)** (Available only in [Pro version](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/poll-maker)) - This is the type of competition with two products or persons. There are awesome styles for making versus votes.
* **Text** (Available only in [Pro version](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/poll-maker)) - Get the most detailed responses. Give poll participants the opportunity to provide full answers to your questions, using both Short Text answers and Paragraphs.

* [Open-Ended question Polls](https://poll-plugin.com/open-ended-question-polls-text-type/)

**Multivote functionality**: By selecting *Choosing* type, you can also activate *Multivote functionality*. It allows your respondents to choose more than one answer to your question. Moreover, you can give a maximum number to it, so your respondents can not vote more than the assigned count of answers to the given question.

= Notify admin by email =

With our Vote plugin, you can be notified via email each time a vote is submitted. All you need is to enable the **Results notification** by email option from your form's settings and enter your email address in the corresponding field. It allows you to be informed and doesn't check your admin dashboard frequently.

Save your time, and in the meantime, be informed with our **WordPress Voting Plugin**!

= Redirection (Individual and Global) =

Redirection is a super-effective technique to **boost your website traffic**. Attract your website visitors via engaging polls and after voting, redirect them to another webpage. You can either redirect no matter the answer they give or redirect based on their answer. The latter one is a powerful **call-to-action** trick. For instance, if you are selling books, you can make a question like *What book genre is your personality?*. Then, redirect the participants to different book pages based on their answers. This a great marketing idea, isn't it?

= Schedule Poll =

Now there is wide used function: **schedule**. We also include this function in our poll builder plugin.

It saves a mass of time. For example, if you are going to make an election in the near future, you don't need to remember and set the alarm for that. You can make it right now and set a start date for displaying it.

Also, it is important to set an end date for the vote, as long as you may need to check product ratings for a **specific period of time**. The plugin will show the expiring message after the end date, which is provided from the dashboard. #1 poll plugin for WP, don't you agree?
Moreover, you can create a [WordPress event poll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMwBPfrFkng&) and schedule it to get people engaged at a certain date. 

= Limit by User Roles =

This feature allows you to select **specific user roles** for displaying your online form. Only users with the selected user group can take it. Also, you can set the restriction that only logged-in users have permission to take the form. There is a message parameter for every option.

= Limit to vote only once =

Want to have **accurate results**? This online voting tool give it to you! By activating the *Maximum number of attempts per user* option, you will not receive multiple votes from the same person. The plugin offers 4 detection methods: *By IP address, by WP user ID, by Cookie, by Cookie and IP*.

= Password Protected Poll =

Create a password-protected poll to ensure privacy, limit participation to only authorized individuals, and safeguard sensitive information or opinions shared during the polling process. This security feature can be useful when the poll involves confidential information, or when the poll is intended for a specific audience or group of individuals. The given feature is available in the [premium version](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/poll-maker) of the plugin.  


= Results page on the front-end =

The plugin lets you configure the result page and customize it on your own. You can either hide the results or display them instantly after the voting. You can choose the way of sorting the results: *Ascending, Descending, or none*. To make your form more engaging, you can activate the *Show passed users avatars* option. It will display the profile pictures of those users who have taken your voting form. You can type in your preferred thank you message, for instance, *Thank you for taking the time to complete this form*. Besides, the plugin allows you to **display different result messages** based on the answer the voter chooses ([Premium feature](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/poll-maker)). Each voter will see an individual message most relevant to him.  Amazing, isn't it?

Want to visualize the result via interactive and beautiful charts? No problem at all! The plugin gives that opportunity.

After or before taking the choice, the user must fill in his information like **name, email, phone**, or any other information you have added into the form. So it is a handy tool for collecting user's data and using it for your marketing.

= Anonymous polls =

Do not want to trace the data to an individual participant? Anonymity is an inseparable part of research conducting, particularly in Europe. After activating the *allow anonymity* option, WP User and the User IP will not be collected in your database.  Furthermore, [anonymous feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrTkFtliTVQ) can give valuable and more accurate answers. Protect the rights of your participants **under GDPR** with us. Please note that the option is available on the [Premium version](https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/poll-maker).

You can choose to show the results via interactive charts: **Bar chart, Pie chart,** or **Column chart**. Other two awesome shortcodes that the plugin offers are the *Categories shortcode* and *Global leaderboard*. The latter one prints the list of top users who have voted your forms.
